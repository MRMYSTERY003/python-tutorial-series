Comming to naming of a variable there are certain rules to name a varibel , let's see what are they

  1.we cannot use key words as a varibale name
      So, what is a key word : a key word is nothing but a word which has specific definition for it or which are predefined by the interpretter
      some of the key words are followed:
        if, else, elif, sum, list, tuple, int, float , bool, class, def, break ,continue, pass , try, except ,etc....
        
  2.we can use alphabets to name our variable 
    we have from a-z and A-Z
 
  3. we can have numbers in our name of the variable
    we can use numbers from 0 - 9
    NOTE : we cannot use numbers in the beginning of a variable like (0num, 234adre, 007number) these are not valide variables
  
  4.we can use (_) underscore in our name of the varibale 
    NOTE: we can use _ in the stariting of a variabel in middle of a variable and at the ending of a variable
    
    
 so any variable name satifies all the 4 conditions are valide variable
 
 examples:
    VALIDE:
       1.num
       2.num_2
       3.num3
       4._num
       5.n_u_m
       6.Num4
       
    INVALIDE:
      1.0num      - number at the beginning of the name
      2.sum       - cannot use keywords in name
      3.-num      - special character (-) is not allowed
      4.$dun      - sepcial character ($) is not allowed
      5.class     - keywords are not allowed
      
NOTE : Num and num are treated diffetent because python is a case sensitive lang, which means N and n are treated differently
