ARITHMETIC OPERATIONS IN AVAILABLE IN PYTHON

we can do arithmetic operation as we do in mathametics,so the availabel operations are followed:
  1. +  - additino
  2. -  - subraction
  3. *  - multiplication
  4. /  - division
  5. %  - modulus
  6. // - integer division
  7. ** - exponent
  
  
  ADDITION (+) :
      as you know addidtion is use to add to are more numbers 
      3+4 = 7 
      a = 5 , b = 6 then a+b gives 11
      
 SUBRACTION (-):
      as you know subraction is use to subract two are more numbers
      3-4 = -1
      a = 5, b = 6 then a-b gives -1
      
  MULTIPLICATION (*):
    as you know multiplication is use to multiplay two are more numbers
    3*4 = 12
    a = 5 ,b = 6 then a*b = 30
    
  DIVISION (/) :
    as you know division is used to divide two numbers
    12/4 = 3
    a = 10, b = 100 then b/a = 10
    
    
  MODULUS (%) :
    here comes the programming part , the modulus operator is used to get the remainder when a number is divide by another number
    if 5 is divided by 2 we get the remainder a 1
        5/2 = 2*2 + 1 : the number after the + is known as remainder and the % operator is used to get this number
        11 % 10 = 1
        55 % 11 = 0
        10 % 5 = 0
        
  INTEGER DIVISSION (//):
    the integre division is used to get the integer term of the quotient when a number is divided by other number
    when 5/2 we get the result as 2.5 , but if we use 5//2 we get the result as 2 , the decimal term is omitted this is known as interger division
    45 // 7 = 6
    77 // 10 = 7
    
    NOTE : the result is not rounded off , if 77/10 = 7.7 then 77//10 gives 7 as the decimal point is omitted
    
  EXPONENT (**):
    the find a to the power b we can use ** as a**b we gives the result as a to the power b
    examples :
        2**3 = 8
        4**2 = 16
        8**2 = 64
