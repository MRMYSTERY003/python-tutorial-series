Input and Output Opetations  

	Inorder to interact with the users the program needs inputs and outputs statements
	for example take a calculator :
		we give numbers and operations as input and it gives the result as an output,
		In python we have those statements know as:
			1.input()
			2.print()

print() statements:
	As the name suggests the print statements prints the output to the screen , and so it is known as a output statement.
	SYNTAX:
		print(statement)
	a syntax can be considered as a formula to write a speific statement
	here the syntax states that the keyword print() 
	statement refers to the statemenst or the expression to be printed
	
	EXAMPLE:
		print(030)  		- output => 030
		print(03.32) 		- output => 03.32
		print('code hub')	- output => code hub
		priny('code hub', 01)   - output => code hub 01

	NOTE: comma(,) is use to seperate two different datatypes that is to be printed in a single 
	      print() statement

input() statements:
	so, inorder to get the input from the user you need a input statement  
	SYNTAX:
		variable = input(prompt)
	so the as the syntax says, anything that we type is observed by the input statement and then 
	it is stored in the varibale
	prompt = prompt is nothing but the statment that is printed for the understanding of the user 
	for example :
		consider the following code,
		num = input()

		in the output you just see the curser blinking but you don't know what you should enter,
		you may enter your name , age , something link that,  to prevent those 	
		confusion we can write the following code
		print('enter a number : ')
		num = input()

		so now in the output screen you can see a statement that says to enter a number , so 
		now you know what you should enter BUT,
		insted of writtin print() and then input() we can write like the following
		
		num = input('enter a number')

		so now the output screen shows the same output screen as the before statement but we 
		did the same thing in a single like 
		that single line is known as prompt , so anything within that '' inside the input() 
		will be printed for the user understanding..


EXAMPLE FOR BOTH INPUT AND PRINT STATEMENT:
	name = input('enter your name: ')
	print('hello and welcome to code hub',name)

	so the above code give the output link as follows:
	
	enter your name: sriram
	hello and welcome to code hub sriram
