Relational or Logical Operators:
  the relational operators available in python are followed:
    1. >   - greater than
    2. <   - lesser than
    3. >=  - greater than equal to
    4. <=  - less than equal to 
    5. ==  -  equal to 
    6. !=  - not equal to 
    
    
 So the result of an relation operation is a boolean value (that is , either True or False)
 NOTE : >= and <= should not be writtern as => or =< these are invalide
        and double equal to (==) is different from single equal to (=)
        =  -  is an assignment operator were as ==  -  is a relational operator
        
EXANPLES:
    1. 4 > 5      - False
    2. 5 < 100    - True
    3. 10 == 11   - False
    4. 5 == 5     - True
    5. 10 != 11   - True
    6. 5 != 5     - False
    7. 'name' == 'Name'     - False
    8. 'A' != 'a' - True
    
    
    
 so these are the basic relation operators avilable in python and these are mainly used in conditional statements (if-elif-else) and looping statements(for , while loops)
