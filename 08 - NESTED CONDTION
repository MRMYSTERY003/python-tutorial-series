Python also provides nested conditional statements...

which means a condtion within a condition

Nested if statements means an if statement inside another if statement.
Yes, Python allows us to nest if statements within if statements.
i.e, we can place an if statement inside another if statement.

if (condition1):
   # Executes when condition1 is true
   if (condition2): 
      # Executes when condition2 is true
   # if Block is end here
# if Block is end here

EXAMPLE PROGRAM :

i = 10
if (i == 10):
    #  First if statement
    if (i < 15):
        print ("i is smaller than 15")
    # Nested - if statement
    # Will only be executed if statement above
    # it is true
    if (i < 12):
        print ("i is smaller than 12 too")
    else:
        print ("i is greater than 15")
        
  
OUTPUT:
i is smaller than 15
i is smaller than 12 too
