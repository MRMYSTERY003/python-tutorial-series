List and Tuple in Python are the class of data structure. The list is dynamic, whereas the tuple has static characteristics. 
List is just like the arrays, declared in other languages. 
Lists need not be homogeneous always which makes it the most powerful tool in Python.
In Python, the list is a type of container in Data Structures,
which is used to store multiple data at the same time. 
Lists are a useful tool for preserving a sequence of data and further iterating over it.

SIMPELY : list is a collection of data types inside [] square brackets

Syntax: 

list_data = ['an', 'example', 'of', 'a', 'list']

Tuple is also a sequence data type that can contain elements of different data types, but these are IMMUTABLE in nature. 
In other words, a tuple is a collection of Python objects separated by commas. 
The tuple is faster than the list because of static in nature. 

SIMPELY: type  is a collection of data types inside () paranthesis

Syntax:  

tuple_data = ('this', 'is', 'an', 'example', 'of', 'tuple')


Difference Between List and Tuple in Python:  

SR.NO.	        LIST                                    	                TUPLE
1	      Lists are mutable	                                          Tuples are immutable
2	      Implication of iterations is Time-consuming               	The implication of iterations is comparatively Faster
3	      The list is better for performing operations, 	            Tuple data type is appropriate for accessing the elements
        such as insertion and deletion.
4	      Lists consume more memory	                                  Tuple consume less memory as compared to the list
5	      Lists have several built-in methods	                        Tuple does not have many built-in methods.
6	      The unexpected changes and errors 	                        In tuple, it is hard to take place.
        are more likely to occur
