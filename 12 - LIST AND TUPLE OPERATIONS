 A few of the basic list operations used in Python programming are 
 
 1.extend(), 
 2.insert(),
 3.append(), 
 4.remove(), 
 5.pop(),
 6.min() 
 7.max(), 
 8.sort(),
 9.sorted()
 10.index(), 
 11.clear(), 
 12.list()
 13.tuple(), etc.
 
  
 1. append()
    The append() method is used to add elements at the end of the list. This method can only add a single element at a time.
    
    EXAMPLE: 
    list1 = [1,2,3,4,5]
    list1.append(6)   #adding 6 at the end
    list1.append(7)   #adding 7 at the end
    print(list1)
    
    OUTPUT:
    [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
    
  2. extend()
      The extend() method is used to add more than one element at the end of the list.
      Although it can add more than one element, unlike append(), it adds them at the end of the list like append()
      
      EXAMPLE:
      list1 = [1,2,3,4,5]
      list1.extend([8,9,10])    #adding 8,9,10 at the end, append use to add single element , extend is use to add multilple elements at the end
      print(list1)
      
      OUTPUT:
      [1,2,3,4,5,8,9,10]
      
 3. insert()
    The insert() method can add an element at a given position in the list. 
    Thus, unlike append(), it can add elements at any position, but like append(), 
    it can add only one element at a time. This method takes two arguments.
    The first argument specifies the position, and the second argument specifies the element to be inserted.
    
    EXAMPLE: 
    list1 = [1,2,3,4,5]
    list1.insert(0, -100)   adding -100 at the 0th index
    print(lsit1)
    
    OUTPUT:
    [-100, 1,2,3,4,5]
    
 4. remove()
    The remove() method is used to remove an element from the list.
    In the case of multiple occurrences of the same element, only the first occurrence is removed.
    
    EXAMPLE:
