 A few of the basic list operations used in Python programming are 
 
 1.extend(), 
 2.insert(),
 3.append(), 
 4.remove(), 
 5.pop(),
 6.min() 
 7.max(), 
 8.sort(),
 9.sorted()
 10.index(), 
 11.clear(), 
 12.list()
 13.tuple(), etc.
 
  
 1. append()
    The append() method is used to add elements at the end of the list. This method can only add a single element at a time.
    
    EXAMPLE: 
    list1 = [1,2,3,4,5]
    list1.append(6)   #adding 6 at the end
    list1.append(7)   #adding 7 at the end
    print(list1)
    
    OUTPUT:
    [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
    
  2. extend()
      The extend() method is used to add more than one element at the end of the list.
      Although it can add more than one element, unlike append(), it adds them at the end of the list like append()
      
      EXAMPLE:
      list1 = [1,2,3,4,5]
      list1.extend([8,9,10])    #adding 8,9,10 at the end, append use to add single element , extend is use to add multilple elements at the end
      print(list1)
      
      OUTPUT:
      [1,2,3,4,5,8,9,10]
      
 3. insert()
    The insert() method can add an element at a given position in the list. 
    Thus, unlike append(), it can add elements at any position, but like append(), 
    it can add only one element at a time. This method takes two arguments.
    The first argument specifies the position, and the second argument specifies the element to be inserted.
    
    EXAMPLE: 
    list1 = [1,2,3,4,5]
    list1.insert(0, -100)   adding -100 at the 0th index
    print(lsit1)
    
    OUTPUT:
    [-100, 1,2,3,4,5]
    
 4. remove()
    The remove() method is used to remove an element from the list.
    In the case of multiple occurrences of the same element, only the first occurrence is removed.
    
    EXAMPLE:
    list1 = [1,2,3,4,5]
    list1.remove(5)
    print(list1)
    
    OUTPUT:
    [1,2,3,4]
    
5. pop()
    The method pop() can remove an element from any position in the list.
    The parameter supplied to this method is the index of the element to be removed.
    
    EXAMPLE:
    list1 = [1,2,3,4,5]
    list1.pop()    # if the index in not specified then the last element will be deleted
    list1.pop(0)   # this deletes the element at 0th index
    
    OUTPUT:
    [2,3,4]
    
6. len()
    The len() method returns the length of the list, i.e. the number of elements in the list.
    
    EXAMPLE:
    list1 = [1,2,3,4,5]
    print(len(list1))
    
    OUTUPT:
    5
    
7. min() & max()
    The min() method returns the minimum value in the list.
    The max() method returns the maximum value in the list.
    Both the methods accept only homogeneous lists, i.e. list having elements of similar type.
    
    EXAMPLE:
    list = [1,2,3,4,5]
    print(min(list))
    print(max(list))
    
    OUTPUT:
    1         #minimum of the list
    5         #maximum of the list
    
8. sort()
    The sort method sorts the list in ascending order. 
    This operation can only be performed on homogeneous lists, i.e. lists having elements of similar type
    SORT METHOD MAKE CHANGES TO THE ORIGINAL LIST
    
    EXAMPLE:
    list1 = [5,3,6,23,2]
    list1.sort()
    print(list1)
    
    OUTPUT:
    [2,3,5,6,23]
    
9.sorted()
    The sort method sorts the list in ascending order. 
    This operation can only be performed on homogeneous lists, i.e. lists having elements of similar type
    UNLIKE SORT , SORTED METHOD RETURNS A NEW LIST AND THE ORIGINAL LIST IS NOT CHANGED
    
    EXAMPLE:
    list1 = [5,3,6,23,2]
    l1 = sorted(list1)
    print(list1)
    print(l1)
    
    OUTPUT:
    [5,3,6,23,2]      #original list
    [2,3,5,6,23]      #new sorted list
    
10. clear()
    clear method is used to delete all the elements in the list , but the list in not deleted 
    
    EXAPMLE:
    list1 = [2,34,5,6,3]
    list1.clear()
    print(list1)
    
    OUTPUT:
    []
    
11. list()
    this method is used to conver the give arguments into a list , we can convert a tuple in to a list, a set into a list 
    
    EXAMPLE:
    tu = (1,2,3,4)
    st = {1,2,3,4}
    l1 = list(tu)
    l2 = list(st)
    print(l1)
    print(l2)
    
    OUTPUT:
    [1,2,3,4]
    [1,2,3,4]
    
12. tuple()
    this method is used to conver the give arguments into a tuple , we can convert a list in to a tuple, a set into a tuple
    
    EXAPMLE:
    li = [1,2,3,4]
    st = {1,2,3,4}
    t1 = tuple(l1)
    t2 = tuple(l2)
    print(t1)
    print(t2)
    
    OUTPUT:
    (1,2,3,4)
    (1,2,3,4)
