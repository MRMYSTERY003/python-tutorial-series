# the basic datatypes availabe in python are followed:

#  1. int = integer(ex. 1, 4,59,0,2,-42,-4 ) all the number from - infinity to + infinity (but all of them are whole numbers)
#  2.float = floating points (or decimal numbers) (ex. 1.0 ,340.32, 0.0, -0.4320, ect) all the number from - infinity to + infinity (but all of them are decimal numbers)
#  3.bool = boolean it is a special data type which can only have either True or False 
#  4.str = string litrally anything given between quetotation is known as a string .(ex. 'code hub', "5323", "0423.42", '''True''') we can use single quotation (''), double ("") or triple quotation(''' ''')
  
#  so these are the four basic datatypes available in python so let's see some example program


# creating 4 variables and storing different datatypes in them
num = 432               #integer
decimal = 20.423        #float
boolean = True          #boolean
string = 'litrally anything... inside this quotation'     #sting

#let's see their datatypes in program , we use type() to know the datatype of a variable
print(type(num))
print(type(decimal))
print(type(boolean))
print(type(string))
